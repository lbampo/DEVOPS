# What Is DevOps? (THE ULTIMATE GUIDE)

**DevOps is an IT mindset that encourages communication, collaboration, integration and automation among software developers and IT operations allowing for the to BUILDing, TESTing and RELEASing of software faster and more reliably.**

--------------------------------------

### DevOps Goals 

* Improve deployment frequency
* Achieve faster time to market
* Lower failure rate of new releases
* Shorten lead time between fixes
* Improve mean time to recovery

--------------------------------------

### DevOps in more detail

#### DevOps is a culture being used by a lot of huge organisations to increase efficiency and improve the quality of the product.

#### Also Used to improve the collaboration of Development and Operation teams so workflow within the organisation becomes smoother

It is a continuous process that contains variuous stages such as:

* Continuos Integration
    Continuous integration is the practice of quickly integrating newly developed code with the main body of code that is to be released. Continuous integration saves a lot of time when the team is ready to release the code.


* Continuos Delivery
    When executing continuous delivery, you add additional automation and testing so that you don’t just merge the code with the main code line frequently, but you get the code nearly ready to deploy with almost no human intervention. It’s the practice of having the code base continuously in a ready-to-deploy state.



* Continuous Deployment
    Practice of deploying all the way into production without any human intervention.

    Teams that utilize continuous delivery don’t deploy untested code; instead, newly created code runs through automated testing before it gets pushed out to production.

### Core operations of DevOps in terms of Development and Infrastructure 

* #### Application development 
 Developing a product that is able to meet all customer requirements and offers a remarkable level of quality

* #### Code coverage 
 A measurement of the total number of blocks or lines or arcs of the code executed while the automated tests are running

* #### Code developing
 Prepare the codebase required for the product development

* #### Configuratiion
 Allowing the product to be used in an optimum way

* #### Deployment
 Installing the software to be used by the end-user

* #### Orchestration
 Arranging of several automated tasks 

* #### Packaging
 Activities involved when release id ready for deployment

* #### Provisioning 
 To make sure the infrastructure changes arrive just-in-time with the code that requires it

* #### Unit Testing 
 Meant for testing individual units or components

* #### Integration Testing
 Meant for testig that different pieces of the modules are working together
