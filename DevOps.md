* Achieve faster time to market
* Lower failure rate of new releases
* Shorten lead time between fixes
* Improve mean time to recovery

### DevOps in more detail

#### DevOps is a culture being used by a lot of huge organisations to increase efficiency and improve the quality of the product.

#### Also Used to improve the collaboration of Development and Operation teams so workflow within the organisation becomes smoother

It is a continuous process that contains variuous stages such as:

* Continuos Integration
    Continuous integration is the practice of quickly integrating newly developed code with the main body of code that is to be released. Continuous integration saves a lot of time when the team is ready to release the code.


* Continuos Delivery
    When executing continuous delivery, you add additional automation and testing so that you don’t just merge the code with the main code line frequently, but you get the code nearly ready to deploy with almost no human intervention. It’s the practice of having the code base continuously in a ready-to-deploy state.



* Continuous Deployment
    Practice of deploying all the way into production without any human intervention.

    Teams that utilize continuous delivery don’t deploy untested code; instead, newly created code runs through automated testing before it gets pushed out to production.
