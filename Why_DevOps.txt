What Is DevOps? (THE ULTIMATE GUIDE)

DevOps is an IT mindset that encourages communication, collaboration, integration and automation among software developers and IT operations in order to improve the speed and quality of delivering software.


DevOps Goals 

* Improve deployment frequency
* Achieve faster time to market
* Lower failure rate of new releases
* Shorten lead time between fixes
* Improve mean time to recovery

CI + CD + CD

* Continuos Integration
    Continuous integration is the practice of quickly integrating newly developed code with the main body of code that is to be released. Continuous integration saves a lot of time when the team is ready to release the code.


* Continuos Delivery
    When executing continuous delivery, you add additional automation and testing so that you don’t just merge the code with the main code line frequently, but you get the code nearly ready to deploy with almost no human intervention. It’s the practice of having the code base continuously in a ready-to-deploy state.



Continuous Deployment
    Practice of deploying all the way into production without any human intervention.

    Teams that utilize continuous delivery don’t deploy untested code; instead, newly created code runs through automated testing before it gets pushed out to production.
